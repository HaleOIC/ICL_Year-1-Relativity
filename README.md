# ICL_Year 1 Relativity

Special relativity is a great thought achievement in the early 20th century, and it is the milestone of modern physics. This course introduces the derivation of special relativity and its experimental results in detail. At the end of the course is a simulation experiment of special relativity, using the Monte Carlo method for simulation, and debugging the code to further deepen the understanding of the results, the course is from Imperial College London, but sorry I do not Know its course index.

- `./codes`: contains the final course work `Relativity Python activity` and its corresponding debug report
- `./notes`: contains the corresponding lecture notes during the course.
- `./seminar`: only contain the seminar 2, which is used to finish the course work
- `./slides`: contains the corresponding lectures during the course.

Hints: do not copy the code directly.....
